*Living Overseas has allowed my transferable skills to be adaptable to also allowing myself to be understood clear and concise with non native speakers, face to face, verbally and in writing* 

*My passion for data was sparked when i had a senior role within Admin, in a school environment*

*My other 2 passions are gardening and reading. I am very happy to be a member of BCS ITNOW, which keeps me up to date with the latest IT advances*

*Working as a Manager for 10 years has well sculpted my leadership skills, critical thinking and working under pressure. Working within an array of roles within a Private sector School for 4 years has prepared me to meet deadlines, perfect time-keeping and keep my ability to think on my feet impeccable*
